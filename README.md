## Abstract
The behavioral response to a threat -- fleeing, freezing, or fighting -- can be innate, and can depend on learning and context. Here we designed a behavioral paradigm to assess the response of mice to an ostensibly innate threat, a live rat. Head-fixed, water deprived mice were habituated to walk on a treadmill. The forward and backward movement of the mouse was tethered to the movement of a reward tube and a virtual visual scene. Once mice achieved threshold criteria, control data was acquired in a single session and experimental data were acquired in a subsequent session where mice were faced with a live rat. Our results suggest that in the presence of the rat, mice continue to forage; they do not freeze or try to run away. But to varying degrees for each mouse, one or more of these features -- running speed, pupil size, eye movement, and posture -- were significantly altered by the presence of the rat. To assess whether head-fixation or foraging pressure changed how mice react to a predator, we presented fear inducing stimuli to naive, freely moving mice. Even in this context a large fraction of mice did not freeze or run away to hide. Even when presented with a freely moving rat, only half of the freely moving mice showed avoidance behavior. Taken together our work suggests that mice do not automatically express fear by freezing or running away even in situations where they are expected to be innately afraid.
